# Data Visualization

In this project, we analyzed 2 datasets (_Tips_ and _Diamonds_) and visualized them.

For each notebook, the following is done: 
    1. Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    2. Analyze dataset.
    3. Visualize data.
    4. Summarize insights at bottom of notebook.

Conclusions:

*Tips*

    - Bill amounts decrease on Fridays.
    - Smokers give a little bit more tips.
    - Bills increase on Saturdays and Sundays. (weekends).

*Diamonds*
    - The diamond price varies based on the color.
    - Ideal-cut diamonds have the highest prices.
    - Fair-cut Diamonds have the highest depths.
